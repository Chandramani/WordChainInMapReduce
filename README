The objective of this application is to write a program that accepts start and end words and, using words from the dictionary, builds a word chain between them and returns the shortest word chain that solves the puzzle.Successive entries in the chain must all be real words (words that are in a dictionary), and each can differ from the previous word by just one letter. For example, you can get from "cat" to "dog" using the following chain.

  cat
  cot
  cog
  dog
